## ✓ MVP — Complete (2026-03-12)

**Goal:** Demonstrate the core loop — intake requirements, generate a blueprint, validate it, store it, and review it.

### MVP Scope

| Component | Status | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Intake Engine | Complete | P0 |
| Generation Engine | Complete | P0 |
| Governance Validator | Complete | P0 |

### MVP Success Criteria

All criteria validated end-to-end on 2026-03-12 (Session 002) against PostgreSQL with a live Anthropic API key.

1. ✓ An enterprise user can provide requirements through the Intake Engine.
2. ✓ The Generation Engine produces a valid ABP from those requirements.
3. ✓ The Governance Validator checks the ABP against a set of policies.
4. ✓ The ABP is stored in the Agent Registry with versioning.
5. ✓ A human reviewer can view and approve/reject the ABP through the Review UI.
